# This file contains all the custom fish abbreviations that I enable. 
# The helpers/abbrs.fish script reads it in and passes each non-comment
# line to abbr with --add or --erase depending on if it's during an install
# or uninstall
#
# Due to a change in 3.6.0 I can't used run abbr --add directly, instead the
# abbreviations are written to ~/.config/fish/conf.d/abbreviations.fish which will
# be loaded on shell start
